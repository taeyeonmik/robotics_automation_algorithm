# Development of a Prototype Robot Automation Algorithm for Local Anesthesia

## Project informations
- periode : 05/2023 - 07/2023
- purpose : to develop a prototype robot automation algorithm that will be applying in medical field, with an implementation of two deep learning detection models having different purposes.   
- lead by : Taeyeon Kim

## Project details
### 1. language and main frame works/libraries
- python
- dobot, pytorch, opencv-python, mediapipe

### 2. data
- image data of injured patients collected from the hospital. Due to the sensitivity of the data and requests from the company, it is not possible to disclose the data.

### 3. detection models
1) yolov7 
- purpose : detecting wounds or cut parts on hands.
2) hand landmarks keypoints detection model from Mediapipe
- purpose : obtaining all hand joint position information from the images.

### 4. algorithms developped
1) Injection -> injection.py
-
- 
2) Robot -> dobotcode/dobot.py
